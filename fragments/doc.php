			<a name="pd"></a>Creating Your Own ProseVis Dataset
		</h3>
		<h4>
			<a name="pw"></a>Data Processing
		</h4>

		<p>
			The ProseVis data processing webform allows ProseVis users to upload
			TEI P5 files for pre-processing in Meandre, a data flow environment
			designed by the <a href="">SEASR</a> group (Software Environment for
			the Advancement of Scholarly Research) at the University of Illinois
			at Urbana-Champaignï¿½s National Center for Supercomputing Applications
			(NCSA) and Graduate School of Library and Information Science.
			Meandre pre-processes TEI P5 texts for analysis. The user creates the
			TEI file. Once uploaded through the web form, the TEI file is
			processed by Meandre, which creates the corresponding TSV files that
			ProseVis reads described below in <a href="#results">Data Results</a>.
			Because ProseVis depends on the structural elements of a files such
			as the &lt;p&gt; or paragraph element or the &lt;lg&gt; line group or
			&lt;l&gt; line elements, the ProseVis Meandre instantiation will only
			take TEI P5 texts at this time, not plain text files. [Please go to <a
				href="http://www.tei-c.org">www.tei-c.org</a> to find out more about
			the TEI encoding guidelines.]

		</p>
		<p>
			The web form through which a user can process their TEI P5 document
			in the ProseVis project is available at <a
				href="http://tclement.ischool.utexas.edu/ProseVis/data/">
				http://tclement.ischool.utexas.edu/ProseVis/data/</a>. Users can
			upload <strong>a single</strong> or <strong>multiple</strong> files
			for pre-processing.
		</p>


		<h4>
			<a name="ps"></a>Analyze single document
		</h4>
		<p>To process just one file, enter the email address where you would
			like to receive your processed file, choose a job name for this test
			(optional), browse for your XML file on your system and select your
			file for uploading. Finally, fill out the Catpcha form before
			selecting submit.</p> <img width="400px" class="displayed"
		src="pics/doc/upload.png" alt="" />
		<p></p>

		<h4>
			<a name="cm"></a>Compare multiple documents
		</h4>
		<p>
			Processing multiple files is a more advanced option in ProseVis that
			allows you to take advantage of the similarity-based discovery
			system. In the ProseVis webform, the researcher is given the
			opportunity to upload a selection of texts, and control the features
			to use for the analysis. <strong>Note:</strong> To compare multiple
			files, you must upload the files in a zipped file. ZIP files must
			contain only the files for processing, no subdirectories.
		</p> <img width="800px" class="displayed" src="pics/doc/multiple.png"
		alt="" />


		<p>The following are the features researchers can use to control the
			experiment:</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Comparison Range</strong> &mdash; This is a comma-separated
			list of indices of the documents to be compared. For example, the
			user can choose to compare just the first document with the remaining
			documents in a set by using '1'. Using '1, 3, 7' means that the
			first, third, and seventh documents will be compared against each
			other and all of the other documents. Using 'all' means that all
			documents will be compared with each other. To change the order of
			your documents, you must change the name. Ordinarily files are listed
			in alphanumerical order.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Window Size</strong> in Sounds &mdash; This is the number of
			phonemes to be considered a phrase for analysis. Because we are
			working on prosodic patterns that are affected by phrasal patterns
			(Clement, et al., 2013), it makes sense for this value to represent
			the average number of sounds in a phrase. If texts use shorter
			phrases, then a smaller window serves as a better representation of
			the average phrase size for a given text. If texts have longer
			phrases, then a larger window might yield more productive results.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Sound Features to Use</strong> &mdash; This refers to the
			attributes of the sounds, which are determined from the features
			extracted by <a href="http://mary.dfki.de/">OpenMary</a> (Modular
			Architecture for Research on speech sYnthesis), an open-source
			text-to-speech system that we have included as a pre-processing
			module in <a href="">Meandre</a>. The features can be used one at a
			time or in combination. The sound features that we use as the default
			selection include (1) <strong>part of speech</strong>; (2) <strong>accent</strong>,
			which indicates the pitch of the sound; (3) <strong>stress</strong>,
			which indicates the presence of a primary or secondary lexical
			stress; (4) <strong>break index</strong>, which indicates when sounds
			precede phrase breaks, sentence breaks, and paragraph final breaks;
			and (5) <strong>tone</strong>, which indicates the location of
			prosodic boundaries and pitch accents by assigning sentence type
			(e.g., declarative, interrogative-W, interrogative-Yes-No and
			exclamatory). These above features focus the machine learning on
			prosodic features that research has shown reflect prosody such as
			part of speech, accent, stress, tone, and break index. If users are
			also interested in comparing the words or sounds themselves, the user
			can also select (6) <strong>sound</strong>, but this feature is not a
			default selection.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Weighting Power</strong> &mdash; This number radically
			controls the behavior of the instance-based learner. Valid values are
			in the range 0 to 100. When weighting power is set to the highest
			value, it heavily weights close matches when computing similarity.
			When set to the lowest value it equally weights all matches. Higher
			weighting power values caused our instance-based learning system to
			use a nearest-neighbor strategy. With lower values more weight is
			given to distant examples, which effectively increases the
			neighborhood size. When set to zero, all training examples are
			equally weighted resulting in a constant prediction reflecting the
			baseline class probabilities.
		</p>

		<h4>
			<a name="results"></a>Data Results
		</h4>
		<p>Your processed XML file and corresponding TSV will be mailed to you
			after some time (more or less depending on how many files you have
			uploaded). You will receive an email wth a link to a ZIP file
			containing a new data set including two types of files: XML and TSV.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <strong>TSV file</strong> contains tabulated data produced by
			OpenMary and the similarity data produced in Meandre. Rendering this
			data is controled in the <a href="#rt">Render Tab</a> and the <a
				href="#com">Comparisons Tab</a>.
		</p> <img width="800px" class="displayed" src="pics/doc/tabdata.png"
		alt="" />
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			The <strong>XML file</strong> will match your uploaded file exactly
			except for the addition of two attributes "xmlns:seasr" and
			"seasr:id" - both of which help ProseVis map the data in the TSV file
			to the XML file structure in the ProseVis <a href="#tp">Text Panel</a>.

		<h3>
			<a name="pi"></a><strong>Using The ProseVis Interface</strong>
		</h3>

		<p>
			Opening ProseVis simultaneously launches two panels &mdash; the <a
				href="#tp">Text Panel</a> and the <a href="#cp">Control Panel</a>.
		</p>
		<h4>
			<a name="tp"></a><strong>Text Panel</strong>
		</h4>
		<p>
			When first launched, the screen will be blank. The Text Panel
			displays all rendering and search results once you have <a href="#af">added
				a file</a> from the <a href="#cp">Control Panel</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once a text has been loaded, its default rendering shows a phrase per
			line without any features colored. When a user moves the cursor over
			a word in ProseVis, the tool tip displays the features of the
			selected word including <a href="#pos">part-of-speech</a>, <a
				href="#sound">sound</a>, and <a href="#mst">similarity data</a>.

			<li><strong> <a name="com"></a>Comparisons Tab
			</strong><br />
				<p>
					In this tab, advanced users can see the results of the similarity
					data layered on top of the text. The similarity data results from

					be represented in Comparisons Tab by a different color (listed on
					the right side of the tab with the file names).
				</p> <img class="displayed" width="600px" src="pics/doc/com1.png"
				alt="" />
				<ul>
					<li><p>Once the user has selected "Refresh", each sound in the Text
							Panel will be highlighted according to which text the software
							has determined it is most likely to belong. When all the texts
							are selected, the color of the sound reflects which book has the

					<li><strong>Smoothing</strong>
						<p>This is a technique used in image processing and statistics to
							"blur" out more detailed features and emphasize the larger scale
							features. In ProseVis, smoothing is used to find longer patterns
							by averaging the similarity values over a neighborhood. Smoothing
							is necessary to take into account the context of the syllable
							with respect to its neighbors. The smoothing function averages
							the similarity values of the N neighbors to the left and to the
							right of the syllable with a window size of 2*N + 1. Users can
							change the parameters in smoothing from 1-19 to see what provides
							the most productive view of the data. Smoothing changes can
							sometimes be dramatic or subtle.</p> <img class="displayed"

							When looking at data for multiple files at once it can be useful
							to deselect <strong>Allow self similarity</strong> since the
							colors will change to reflect the highest probabilities that
							remain after taking the text itself out of the comparison set.
							This is particularly useful when you are working with multiple
							files.
